First of all, we need a Schema

Each **schema** maps to a MongoDB **collection**.

It defines the **shape** of the **documents** within that collection. 

Schemas are building blocks for Models, They can be nested to create complex models

A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

mongo db store data inside collections

and a db can have as many collections eg: users, Blog posts, Comments

a user collections stores user datas or user documents 
a comments stores collects comments datas or comment documents

 different types of documents stored in own groups or collection
