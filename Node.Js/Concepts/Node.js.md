Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome’s core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment which runs JavaScript code outside of the browser. A “runtime” converts code written in a high-level, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute. Node was created with the goal of building web servers and web applications in JavaScript, but it’s a powerful and flexible environment that can be used for building all sorts of applications.


used to build backed services - api  

ideal for highly scalable data intensive and real time backed services apps

why

great for performance and agile development 
super fast and highly scalable
js everywhere
cleaner and more consistent
large ecosystem of open source  libraries


Node js is an non blocking or Async Architecture


## Story

For a long time, the browser was the only place JavaScript code could be executed. Web developers had to use a different programming language on the front-end than the back-end. It also meant that, even as JavaScript evolved into a more robust and powerful language, it remained a front-end only language.

Though multiple attempts to create off-browser JavaScript environments have been attempted, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), invented by Ryan Dahl in 2009, found unprecedented popularity and is currently being used by numerous top-tier companies including Netflix, Uber, Paypal, and eBay.

Node.js is a JavaScript _runtime_, or an environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser.

A “runtime” converts code written in a _high-level_, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute.

Though Node was created with the goal of building web servers and web applications in JavaScript, it can also be used for creating command-line applications or desktop applications.
