**HTTP**, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a request-response protocol that serves as the foundation of data exchange and communication within the client-server computing model. 

What this means in simpler terms is that HTTP helps facilitate the exchange of information between a client (i.e. website, mobile app, etc.) and a server.

At a base level, the operation of HTTP can be explained quite simply in the following steps detailing the request-response paradigm between a client and a server:

1. The client submits an HTTP _request_ message to the server.
2. The server receives the HTTP request, performs some [functions](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/functions) on behalf of the client according to the request.
3. The server returns a _response_ message to the client containing important information about the processing of the request.
