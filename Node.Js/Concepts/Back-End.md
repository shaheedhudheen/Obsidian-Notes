The web application’s back-end will need to hold the logic for deciding which assets to send.
Moreover, modern web applications often cater to the specific user rather than sending the same files to every visitor of a webpage. This is known as _dynamic content_.

The collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, process payments, and myriad other tasks is sometimes known as the “application” or _application server_.

In order to deliver the front-end of a website or web application to a user, a lot needs to happen behind the scenes on the back-end! Understanding what makes up the back-end can be overwhelming because the back-end has a lot of different parts, and different websites or web applications can have dramatically different back-ends. We covered a lot in this lesson,

- The front-end of a website or application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a client, like a web browser.
- A web server is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming [requests](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/requests) for information over the internet and sends back responses.
- Storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application’s back-end
- Data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases.
- The server-side of a web application, sometimes called the application server, handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication.
- The back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an application’s data through HTTP requests and responses.
- Together the technologies used to build the front-end and back-end of a web application are known as the stack, and many different languages and frameworks can be used to build a robust back-end.
