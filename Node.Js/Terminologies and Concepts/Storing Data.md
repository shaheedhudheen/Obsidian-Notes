Databases are collections of information. 

There are many different databases, but we can divide them into two types: 
[relational databases](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rdbms-sql)
and
[non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL databases)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL).

*relational databases* store information in tables with columns and rows,

*non-relational databases* might use other systems such as key-value pairs or a document [storage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/storage) model. _SQL_,

**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is a programming language for accessing and changing data stored in relational databases. Popular relational databases include [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) while popular NoSQL databases include [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/).
