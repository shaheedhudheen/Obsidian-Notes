Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chromeâ€™s core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.



used to build backed services - api  

ideal for highly scalable data intensive and real time backed services apps

why

great for performance and agile development 
super fast and highly scalable
js everywhere
cleaner and more consistent
large ecosystem of open source  libraries


Node js is an non blocking or Async Architecture
