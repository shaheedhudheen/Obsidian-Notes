## What is JSON?

 JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a popular, language-independent, standard format for storing and exchanging data. Adopted by [ECMA International](http://ecma-international.org/), an industry association founded in 1961 to standardize information and communication systems, [JSON](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) has become the de facto standard that facilitates storing and sending data between all [programming languages](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/).
