Web server

A _web server_ is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming [requests](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/requests) for information over the internet and sends back responses.

Each time a user navigates to a website on their browser, the browser makes a request to the web server of that website.

Every website has at least one web server. A large company like Facebook has thousands of powerful computers running web servers in facilities located all around the world which are listening for requests, but we could also run a simple web server from our own computer!

The specific format of a request (and the resulting response) is called the _protocol_.

Web Protocol - **HTTP**

HTTP. When a visitor navigates to a website on their browser, similarly to how one places an order for takeout, they make [an HTTP request](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/http-requests) for the resources that make up that site


For the simplest websites, a client makes a single request. The web server receives that request and sends the client a response containing everything needed to view the website. This is called a _static website_.
